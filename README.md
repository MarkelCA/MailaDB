This is a personal project meant to learn about databases. To do so I'm trying to create my own one, following the book *"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"* as a guideline from Martin Kleppmann.

# MailaDB
MailaDB it's a simple key-value store. To create it I'm being inspired from other key value stores like Google's [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb/tree/main) or [Bitcast](https://github.com/basho/bitcask).
