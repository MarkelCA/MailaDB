> In the simplified representation where you store the key and value lengths as integers, you are indeed reserving additional space in the file for these integer values. If your keys and values are relatively small, this can reqsult in wasted space, especially if the integer size (typically 4 bytes) is larger than the actual length of your keys and values.

> For example, if you're storing short keys and values like "name" and "John", you are using more space to store the lengths (8 bytes in total) than you are using to store the actual data (8 bytes for the key and value combined).

>  Variable-Length Encoding: Instead of reserving a fixed number of bytes for the length of each key and value, you can use a variable-length encoding. For example, you could use a single byte to represent lengths up to 255, two bytes for lengths up to 65,535, and so on. This approach would be more space-efficient for short keys and values.
