# Read
- As an indexing strategy the fseek function could be used to read from an offset byte position. [More Info](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fseek).

- A common buffer size used for reading lines is around 4096 bytes (4 KB), as it often aligns well with disk block sizes and provides a good balance between memory usage and performance.
