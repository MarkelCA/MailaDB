- [ ] Optimize stored space. 
    - Is always stored 4 bytes for the key lenght, even if there aren't used. [[optimizations/Binary Encoding|Binary Encoding]]]
- [ ] Add a network adapter.
    - Currently the only way to use the database it's through a cli. This isn't very useful.
- [ ] Add indexing.
    - Add an indexing algorithm. For example:
        - Byte-offset stored in memory for every key
        - LSM-Tree
        - B+ Tree
- [ ] Add log compaction
- [ ] Add users & permissions
- [ ] Might be interesting to use a documentation generator as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
